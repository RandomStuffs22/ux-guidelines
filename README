UXP PATTERNS WEBSITE
********************

GOAL: 
-To expose few UXP pattern to everyone
-To create a "knowledge" database for UXP stuff based in a first time on our UXP Pattern.

So we started to build a website, by exporting our patterns from Google Doc to HTML and apply Bootstrap style.

ROADMAP:
- Make the HomePage clearer and more beautiful
- Adapt HTML of patterns to make them very clear and easy to read
- Adapt pattern to directly use Twitter Bootstrap component (for exemple, for the pagination or for modal errors...)
- Continue to export other patterns.

A repository named uxp-patterns-website is used to keep track all the work.

DONE:
- Basic google docs for uxp pattern: Breadcrumbs, Hover Reveal Actions, Messages, Pop-ups, Pagination, Thumbnails
- Basic HTML format for: Breadcrumbs, Hover Reveal Actions, Messages, Pop-ups, Pagination, Thumbnails 
- Apply Bootstraps components and dynamic samples for Breadcrumbs, Hover Reveal Actions, Pagination, Thumbnail

PLAN:
- Continue applying Bootstraps components and dynamic samples for current patterns
- Update and improve the website based on feedbacks
- Continue to compose the other pattern.
